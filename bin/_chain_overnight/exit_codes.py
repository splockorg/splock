"""Closed-enum exit codes for `bin/chain-overnight`.

Per implplan §A.impl.3a (cross-CLI shared exit-code registry, lines
452-528). The chain driver consumes exit codes from the binaries it
orchestrates (`bin/plan`, `bin/implplan`, `bin/verify_plan`,
`bin/_retry_loop/main.py`, etc.) AND emits its own codes for halts that
originate in the driver layer.

Discipline:
- Numeric assignments here MUST match A.impl.3a verbatim. Code 9
  (`sealed_path_refused`) is §A-owned. Code 7 / 10 / 16 / 17 are
  shared and propagated from §B / §D / §F.
- Code 20 / 21 are §A-owned (concurrent-chain refusal + foreign-sentinel
  detect) per A.impl.4 v1.2.
- Code 18 is §A-owned for operator-kill (per A.impl.10 #2 RATIFIED
  2026-05-21; mechanism in §A.5 v1.2 Hole H.4 resolution).

The chain driver does NOT invent new codes; if a downstream binary
returns an unfamiliar code, the driver wraps it in code 10
(`phase_boundary_halt`) and surfaces the underlying code in the
completion summary's `## Chain execution` section per plan §A.5a.
